           <div class="col-sm-8 col-xs-6">David Baldacci has written some excellent stories and I've read nearly every one! However,in THE LAST MILE, his new character of Amos Decker, as introduced in Baldacci's MEMORY MAN, the first in this series, is even more exciting and suspenseful than the first! The book expands on the main character, Amos Decker and the rest of his "investigative crew" now involved in full time FBI cases,while throwing in a lot of action and a twisting tale filled with danger, suspense, drama and a lot of mystery! This is a must read kind of tale that leaves you fulfilled but wanting even more! Great story!</div>
