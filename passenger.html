           <div class="col-sm-8 col-xs-6">I may no longer be the target audience for this book but I still enjoy some YA fiction now and again. This was pretty bad. I haven't even been able to force myself to finish it to even see if there were any redeeming qualities. The romance springs from pretty much nothing which is fairly common in the genre. But what really irritates me is that this book tries so hard to preach equality. Which can definitely be a good thing but not so much in this story. It detracts all reality. She thinks someone she loves is murdered and she doesn't seem to give two s**ts but travel back in time ( when it's pretty common that people would be racist/sexist ) and she gets very offended whenever anyone slights someone for gender or race. Her emotions don't come across as real whatsoever which makes it incredibly hard to feel any emotional attachment to her at all. The same could be said for most of the characters. I liked the concept of the story and even thought it'd be fascinating to see a modern girl in previous times trying to adjust to expectations. But it fell flat. Very flat. Her lack of emotion in what drove her to complete tasks makes it a slow drag which is pretty much the enemy of quick fun YA reads.</div>
