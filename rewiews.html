		<h1>The Girl on a train</h1>

		Whenever there is one of these books, you know the ones, where the movie rights are sold as soon as the book comes off the press, I am two things: intrigued and skeptical. Intrigued - what is it about this book that has captured so many people so quickly? Skeptical – what did the marketing machine do to get this book out to so many people so quickly? Usually I don’t trust the big brotheresque marketing machine that seems to decide what the population is going to like before we even get it.
		
		With that being said, I like to think that I go into these things with an open mind, and to be honest, I was immediately drawn into Rachel’s story. I loved the back and forth start of the story; I found that it complemented the confused storyline going on within Rachel’s mind. At several points in the story, I found myself asking (just like Rachel) – “Wait, what just happened?” I felt like I was right there with Rachel on that train ride to hell.

		I’ve read quite a bit of complaining about the characters in The Girl on the Train. Personally, I thought that they were created brilliantly. Not one of them likable, hardly a redeemable characteristic amongst them. From the cheating spouses, the raging alcoholic, to the liars and manipulators…I loved to hate them all. Normally, I like to have a connection with a character, but with The Girl on the Train I was in complete shock at the depths of self-important assholery these characters could reach. It was a character train wreck, and I could not look away.

		I dragged my wife to the movie shortly after I read the book (she actually came quite willingly). Did it live up to the book? No. Did it do the book justice? Yes. And my wife loved it! Will I read another book by Paula Hawkins in the future? Absolutely!

		The Girl on the Train truly was a ride on a crazy train.

		I don't really know how to write this review, but it needs to be said. For the first few chapters I was both enchanted and intrigued by the idea of “Death” telling a story about Germans living through Hitler’s war. But after a while the ephemeral voice of Death left me irritated. It took me a couple of weeks of nightly reading to get through 539 pages. At the end of each short chapter.... almost at every break between paragraphs... I felt weary from the interruptions, the going back and forth in time, the getting in and out of the minds of several characters, and by the discontinuity which left me charmed and impatient in turn; impatience eventually overriding the charm. Here is "Death" gradually unfolding an account of how a poor German family lives during the most destructive war in history. As a student of Nazi Germany, I often felt I was reading through cotton fluff. In other moments, I saw the chill of it. Rarely did I feel the danger. It was like riding on a cloud.

		And THAT, perhaps was the author’s intent. Riding on a cloud.

		This review will be of no help to others trying to decide whether to buy the book. It's an award winner, it's beautifully written, but I was left disappointed, even deflated.

		I note that this novel is suitable for young readers, 11 and up. I can't imagine an 11 year-old - or even a 16 year-old - persisting through 539 pages.

		Finally, I think Markus Zusak is a wonderfully talented writer.

		<h2>8,4/10</h2>

		I am a very big Mortal Instruments fan and this is perfect for anyone who loves the book series.

		I was at first confused at what was in it but once I got it I realized what it meant.

		You get a couple Rune tattoos

		A rune pendant necklace

		A mini book that contains pictures and quotes from the book

		And two magnets

		Overall it is a good buy and I am glad I have it!

		Michael Robotham has to be one of my favourite authors. His books are always either a 4 1/2-5 star rating by me (mostly 5). This book was as consistenly excellent as his previous books and my one regret is that I now only have 2 more books of his to read! I love his characters Joe O'Loughlin and Vincent Ruiz series. The books are always extremely readable and literate psychological thrillers. This book was a compulsive page turner for me. I found the story of the two abducted teenagers, Tash and Piper to be compelling. I really liked the chapters that were written in Piper's voice as I felt I was getting to know her, not just as a victim, but as a person...a typical teenager in a very untypical situation. Robotham has a way of writing that draws you in to his characters. I found it hard to turn the last page of this book as I hated to say goodbye to them, even for a short time.

		I am a sucker for a Mary Kubica book! The narrative is divided in true Kubica fashion through multiple viewpoints. Clara, as she desperately hunts for answers and Nick, told through his last months before the crash. Unlike her previous novels, I felt like this one really delved into the characters and developed them. I had so many ideas throughout this reading. I continuously was guessing, changing my mind and adding new theories into the mix. Did Nick have an affair? Was he attacked? Did Clara have anything to do with this? Did he fake his own death? Is this a dream? Is Clara in a psych ward? I was constantly frustrated, and entertained, as Kubica weaved the plot

		I think my favourite thing about a Kubica novel is the fact that her narratives are never outlandish or far-fetched. The eeriness surrounding the plots is because they are so simple. They are truly something that could happen to anyone.

		This is absolutely not a traditional thriller, this is not a rollercoaster ride with red herrings and doom around every corner, and it will not be for every reader, however, if you like a book that is eerily realistic that will keep you guessing, Every Last Lie is a brilliant choice!
