		Whenever there is one of these books, you know the ones, where the movie rights are sold as soon as the book comes off the press, I am two things: intrigued and skeptical. Intrigued - what is it about this book that has captured so many people so quickly? Skeptical – what did the marketing machine do to get this book out to so many people so quickly? Usually I don’t trust the big brotheresque marketing machine that seems to decide what the population is going to like before we even get it.
		
		With that being said, I like to think that I go into these things with an open mind, and to be honest, I was immediately drawn into Rachel’s story. I loved the back and forth start of the story; I found that it complemented the confused storyline going on within Rachel’s mind. At several points in the story, I found myself asking (just like Rachel) – “Wait, what just happened?” I felt like I was right there with Rachel on that train ride to hell.

		I’ve read quite a bit of complaining about the characters in The Girl on the Train. Personally, I thought that they were created brilliantly. Not one of them likable, hardly a redeemable characteristic amongst them. From the cheating spouses, the raging alcoholic, to the liars and manipulators…I loved to hate them all. Normally, I like to have a connection with a character, but with The Girl on the Train I was in complete shock at the depths of self-important assholery these characters could reach. It was a character train wreck, and I could not look away.

		I dragged my wife to the movie shortly after I read the book (she actually came quite willingly). Did it live up to the book? No. Did it do the book justice? Yes. And my wife loved it! Will I read another book by Paula Hawkins in the future? Absolutely!

		The Girl on the Train truly was a ride on a crazy train.
