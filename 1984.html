           <div class="col-sm-8 col-xs-6">I believe '1984' is standard reading for many high school/college English classes, but it wasn't in mine. I decided to read it on my own this summer, and boy am I glad I did.
		   1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, a man who lives in THE totalitarian government, wants to fight back, and isn't entirely sure how. He is watched almost all the time, must be constantly on guard against showing dissent from the party, or else he will be disappeared. While he and similar characters aren't exactly brimming with personality, they don't need to be to make this book good.
		   The greatest thing about this book is the government itself. A common saying in this book is [paraphrased] 'he who controls the past controls the future, and he who controls the present controls the past'. Orwell goes into detail on how to accomplish this, and delivers on all of the horror, both stated and unstated, that goes along with it. The even more classic line 'War is Peace' is brought up, and explained in such a way that I even found it plausible in a severely twisted sort of way. And the worst part? All of this misery, terror, and oppresion? It's entirely believable that it could happen to us. The government doesn't need any sci-fi tech to take absolute control, and they don't need it. Heck, North Korea is doing something similar right now!
		   One minor thing I have to say I like is the prose. A lot the book I've read that are sixty years have a lot of archaic grammar and word choice. 1984 doesn't for the most part.
		   I recommend this book to anyone interested in classic literature, second only to 'Catch-22' in my list of books you should read. So, you know, buy it.</div>
