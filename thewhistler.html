           <div class="col-sm-8 col-xs-6">It started okay. The story is compelling till about half way in. Then the pace picks up to the point of disbelief and stupidity. The last 10% was like a yada yada yada recitation of this judge did this, the FBI did this, the criminals were sentenced thusly. It was like Mr. Grisham was in a hurry to finish, a!most as though he had lost interest in his own story. The biggest disappointment was the ending. There was absolutely NO resolution for the character who appeared to be central to the plot. Junior Mace even had his own prequel. What was the point of the novella Witness to a Trial? I guess it sorta set the stage but it was disappointing that it didn't come full circle. I felt like any ol Grisham wannabe could have written this.</div>
