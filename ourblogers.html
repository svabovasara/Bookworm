		  <div>
		   <p>"With this book, the rating speaks for itself. The great ratings were the only reason I chose this book but I'm quite greatfull that I did. While at first, a futuristic, yet medieval spin on The Bachelor might sound odd, it is quite fun."</p>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		   <p>"It had promise, but the characters got annoying fairly quickly. I spent more time saying, "Really? That's stupid," about the main characters' actions more than enjoying the story. Decent mindless entertainment but I've ready dime romance novels that did the same with less annoyance."</p>

The author’s imagination is amazing which draw me into the story so completely that it's hard to put the book down. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. All in all, this is a really good book."</p>

		   <div>
		     <p>"It was extraoridinary! It was so great I couldn't put it down. It was one of the best books I have ever read and that's saying a lot since I've read tons. It was amazing and it changed my perspective about life. Definitely worth the time!"</p>
		   </div>
		   <div>
		     <p>"This isn't the best written story I have read, Katniss is not a particularly sympathetic / relatable main character, and yet I could not put this book down. The Hunger Games has a way of getting into your head, it is an example of some very clever story telling that explores some very dark themes, and despite not being able to fully connect with the main character, you can still admire her skills and determination."</p>
		   </div>
		   <div>
		     <p>"This book is great... I couldn't put it down, need I say more? There's no way anyone could get me away from reading it.... I read all three and the last one took me by surprise... this book is drama, confusion, action, and most of all the best love triangle I've ever seen in my life.... I would lose my breath when I turned the page and something completely random would happen... I LOVED IT!!!!!!!"</p>

		    <p>"This book isn't going to win any great literature awards, but it is a pleasant and quick read - perfect for a day by the pool or at the beach. It's the story of life and drama in the 'burbs, as told by several of the neighbors. The author's writing style is straightforward and easy to read, and the story does have a couple twists. The characters are well written, I felt like I knew them and a couple could easily have been my real-life neighbors, but I still wasn't invested in them. Overall a good read, but something kept me from really connecting with the story and characters. If you want a book to pass a lazy summer day, this is the one for you."</p>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		     <p>"I could not put this book down. The Things We Wish Were True follows a group of neighbors over one summer. Everyone is keeping secrets, and they unfold slowly in this character-driven novel. The characters are brought together by a boy’s near-drowning at the neighborhood pool. The book switches between many characters, and that’s what kept my interest since character-driven books aren’t usually my thing."</p>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		     <p>The characters are quite diverse, but they all have their own struggles. I loved them all. I blew through this book in just a couple of days. I had to know what the secrets were, and I wanted to see everything work out well for all of the characters. This novel was just pure delight to read. I need to get my hands on more books by Marybeth."</p>

		     <p>"Folks, this little book was a treasure, a journey sometimes pleasant, sometimes perilous, but always gripping, through a bucolic and almost too-good-to-be-true fictitious suburban enclave just outside the very real metropolis of Charlotte, NC. I can attest to the landscape's atmosphere conjured in deft, often lyrical prose by the author--I've been there and seen that back in the day, and it's real enough. Without trying, I believe you can actually smell the chlorine, hot asphalt, cut grass, and hear the sounds of kids at the pool, amplified by the concrete surround and the humid, breathless air."</p>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		     <p>"I am an avid reader but seldom feel the need or the inspiration to write a review about a novel. Yet, I felt to do some in this instance because this book was unlike any I have ever read. The story is well written and at first hard to follow because of the alternating persons narrating the story. The story begins with the yearly opening of the neighborhood pool. At first, there seems no connection with the characters but as the truth reveals itself piece by piece it is shown that the characters are connected in the story which eachother."</p>
