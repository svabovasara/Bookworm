		I couldn't wait to read still another installment featuring Dan Brown's character, the brilliant professor, Robert Langdon . In Inferno Robert Langdon meets Sienna Brooks a young woman almost as brilliant as him. Unfortunately he can't remember her as he awakens in a hospital bed with amnesia. After an attack on his doctor and with the help of Sienna he embarks on a life and death escape from people who for whatever reason want to kill him. His only clues are in Dante's Divine Comedy. We, readers are taken on a wild tour of Florence, Venice and Istanbul. The story ends up having as many twists and turns as these ancient city streets. I almost gave this 4 stars for the fact that so much description was given to the locales and backgrounds of Dante and other artists. But the story doesn't disappoint and is no doubt controversial in it's thought. My only regret is the fact that I didn't get the illustrated version, which I may still do. I urge those who haven't got their copies yet to get the illustrated book which is also available for Kindle.
