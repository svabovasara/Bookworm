		I couldn't wait to read still another installment featuring Dan Brown's character, the brilliant professor, Robert Langdon . In Inferno Robert Langdon meets Sienna Brooks a young woman almost as brilliant as him. Unfortunately he can't remember her as he awakens in a hospital bed with amnesia. After an attack on his doctor and with the help of Sienna he embarks on a life and death escape from people who for whatever reason want to kill him. His only clues are in Dante's Divine Comedy. We, readers are taken on a wild tour of Florence, Venice and Istanbul. The story ends up having as many twists and turns as these ancient city streets. I almost gave this 4 stars for the fact that so much description was given to the locales and backgrounds of Dante and other artists. But the story doesn't disappoint and is no doubt controversial in it's thought. My only regret is the fact that I didn't get the illustrated version, which I may still do. I urge those who haven't got their copies yet to get the illustrated book which is also available for Kindle.

		As always, Dan Brown does not fail to entertain and keep the reader on the edge of their seat. Angels and Demons, although written first, was just as exciting as the Da Vinci code. I read this on my Kindle and I was surprised by the number of chapters - 137 - and page numbers were not synced with the paper edition. But, nevermind, the length, it was a page turner and the short chapters did make it go quickly. I read this while on vacation and it was a great way to make a 4 hour plane ride go quickly. It has been a while since I saw the movie, but I think that the movie script did not follow the book as closely as the Da Vinci Code did and there were some minor differences with the characters, but the overall plot was the same. If you are looking for an exciting book that makes you think, gives factual information that maybe you didn't know and thoroughly keeps you involved and entertained, then this is the book for you.

		I read this book for the first time 7 years ago. By then, I had been out of high school for 3 years. This book changed the way I saw horror fiction . For the weeks I read 'IT' , & several weeks after I'd finished, this novel had me looking over my shoulder at night leaving work , or just walking down my street every day. The Losers kids, Bower's Gang, & the titular IT became apart of my mind & life that summer, & has stayed with me in my anticipation of the new & upcoming adaption. I hope it does Derry, & that monstrous thing that lives under (off of) Derry justice!

		In a future society, books are forbidden and "firemen" responsible for burning the remaining titles. That's the job of one Guy Montag, but he begins to question his role as he gets in contact with a teenager who reads secretly. And he becomes himself a criminal reader of smuggled books.

		The most surprising thing about Fahrenheit 451 is that it's premise could, in the hands of a lesser writer, easily turn a condescending little lesson about the importance of reading books. But like any work of art that would be missed if it was burned, Fahrenheit 451 doesn't want to give you answers. The book wants you to ask questions.

		The main point for me is not that books are burned. That is only the most dramatic side of something bigger: that society allows them to be burned, and that no one is interested in reading in the first place. The only sources of distraction for the denizens of Fahrenheit 451 are sports or soap operas in televisions the size of entire walls. The speed of television does not allow you to stop and think, just swallow that entertainment loaf. From this insipid entertainment are born people who literally talk to the walls and a society unable to question.

		Montag's wife, Mildred is one example. She can't talk about anything other than the soaps or what threatens her financial security. She is a cattle-person, described as having an invisible cataract behind her pupils, afraid of anything different, incapable of thinking or feeling without directions from the TV or authorities. Montag discovers how they can't connect to one another because in the end they don't know their own history. And without that knowledge you can't even know who you are, or what you want.

		I've heard so much about this book and have wanted to read it for a while now; but I was soooo nervous it'd be overhyped so let me preface this review by saying it was well worth its hype!

		That being said, I'm really frustrated with its ending. I wanted the story to be wrapped with a nice, pretty, happy ending, and it WASN'T. But I loved the writing style. I was hooked early and it continued to maintain its good pacing. Each character felt three-dimensional because they had their own dialect, personalities, and clear motivations. I started off liking Nick and as we learned more about him, I liked him less and even hated him for a bit; until we met Amy in "part 2". From part 2 onward, I HATED AMY. Did mention how much I grew to HATE Amy? I've never hated a character as much as I grew to hate Amy, then I began to feel sorry for Nick and everyone who Amy has interacted with.

		This was quite the page-turner. I got nervous, sad, angry, confused, anxious, scared, and lots of other emotions. This is one of my top reads for the year. I fully intend to give Gillian's other books a try after reading this.

		P.S.: Just one olive though.
