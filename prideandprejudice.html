           <div class="col-sm-8 col-xs-6">This is one of my favorite books ever, one which I re-read over and over. I downloaded this one on my Kindle because I have lent out or given away my other copies and my friends are reading it again. The same wonderful writing, but this Kindle edition is a disgrace! It appears that someone had it on a disc and downloaded it without even looking at it and left it to arrange itself willy nilly on the pages. Many, many words that perhaps were divided at the end of a line are now appearing in the middle of the line. They contain a hyphen in the middle of words that never would be hyphenated in that place. Many pages are only half pages for no reason, plus this must be a completely different book from the ones mentioned with all the wonderful pictures, because there is nothing like that in my copy. This is a book which I ordinarily love and it is ruined by all the weird things done to it on every page. My editor mind keeps screaming for a blue pencil instead of enjoying the dry humor and precise sentences of the story.</div>
