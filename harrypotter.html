		   Huge Harry Potter fan-- 16 years of reading!! So I was incredibly excited for the new one. I keep wondering if there's a therapy group where all the disgruntled fans can congragate and weep together. I'm also refusing to consider in cannon as it was not JKR herself who penned. What they did to the INTEGRITY of these characters. I'm sick over it. The entire 7 book series was about friendship, love and loyalty, and Harry knew that; and most importantly, knew that's what made him different from V. You're telling me, he, Ron and Herm didn't continue to live and instil those values in their children? Rose was a bully, who was prejudice against someone without knowing them first. Harry would never said he wished his kid wasn't his, or sacrificed his kid's only friendship over gosip. Harry wouldn't have choosen work over time with his family, which after all he'd been through WAS ALL HE EVER WANTED.
		   If someone were to ask me, what is your favorite thing about Harry Potter?, I would hands down reply: Harry Potter's moral integrity, that is the heart of the series. It's his choosing to sacrifice himself for what is good. It's choosing friendship over suspicion. It's a defiant effort to turn towards the pain of loving and losing, then choosing not to love at all. It's choosing to do what right, and best for others even when it hurts, is inconvenient, or scary. It's fighting for truth and justice, even when you're the only one doing it. And when you move away from those central themes, the integrity of who we know Harry (and friends) to have PROVEN himself to be, you destroy Harry Potter and all that he stood for for 7 books. This new book is the worst kind of trash, the one that destroys the soul of our hero.</div>
